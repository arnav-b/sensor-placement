# Sensor Placement

Code for sensor placement experiments. 

## Organization

Utility functions are in `sensors.py`. Experiments are in `flows-tntp.ipynb` (greedy flow selection), `speeds.ipynb` (greedy smooth selection), and `unknown-flows.ipynb` (unknown/partially unknown/noisy flows). 

Some unsuccessful attempts to generate realistic flows with SUMO are in `out`. 

## Datasets

Transportation networks dataset is at https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks. 

L.A. dataset is in `out/small.results.csv`.
